The self-driving pizza delivery robot! This project is an exploration into the reinforcement learning algorithm, [Q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning). Inspired by the OpenAI Gym's Smartcab simulation, in the simulationa self-driving pizza delivery car learns to navigate a simple grid and deliver pizzas to various destinations.

This project is being created by members of the [DVHackers](https://www.dvhackers.com), a Computer Science club at Diablo Valley College; led by [Jacob Hanson](https://github.com/jhanreg11).
